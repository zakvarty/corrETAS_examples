MCMC	Model	Data	True rho	What is fixed? 			All Okay?
2.1		Corr	Corr	0.6			Rho, all else free. 	Nope, overestimating n_trig \approx 430 rather than 239. Try starting at true
2.2 	Corr 	Corr	0.6			Rho, all else free. 	Nope, still goes up to 420ish triggered. nu_t and xi_t way too big. Try fixing B.
2.3 	Corr 	Corr 	0.6 		Rho, B.									Not really. ETAS are okay but marginal mag parameters are not being recovered. 
2.4 	Corr	Dual	0.0 		Rho, B. 				ETAS all okay. Magnitude parameters are not 

_____ FIXED ITERAION COUNTER ERROR line 671 _______

2.4 	Corr 	Dual 	0.0 		Rho, B.					ETAS all okay, Magnitude parmaters now okay. Try releasing rho.
2.5		Corr 	Dual 	0.0 		B 						ETAS all okay, Matngutes and rho still okay. Try releasing B. 
2.6 	Corr 	Dual 	0.0         Nothing.				NB starting at truth of everything. All seems good here. Try a worse start. 
2.7 	Corr 	Dual 	0.0 		Nothing. 				Lingereda t 420 trig, settled to truth. All looking good :)

__ TESTING ON CORRELATED CATALOGE NOW _____

2.8 	Corr 	Corr 	0.6 		Nothing.				All good. Do longer runs of 2.7 and 2.8, say 5000 samples. 
2.9 	Corr 	Dual 	0.0 		Nothing.				Long run of 2.7. All good. 
2.10 	Corr 	Corr 	0.6 		Nothing. 				Still running. Compare psi posteriors for correlated catalogue when using dual or correlated model
